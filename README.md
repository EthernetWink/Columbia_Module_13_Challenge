# Columbia_Module_13_Challenge

# Objective

The objective that the code in the attached notbook has is to predict whether or not someone is successful
It does this by using a Deep Neural Network and fitting it to a dataframe of features including things about the person to predict if they are successful

There are also examples of three different neural networks involved. 
An original one, and two alternative ones
The reason for this is to showcase the difference between the 3 models when it comes to the amount of layers and nodes in each hidden layer.
